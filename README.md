# DWBI
Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence

## Takeaway from Project:
Through this project, I learnt to design a star schema that is meant for storing data to be analyzed. I also learnt to use Alteryx for data cleaning and transformation, along with using SQL scripts to create tables and import data from csv files. Finally, I learnt how to generate insights and recommendations from interpreting data and visualizations I have created, and present them to stakeholders of the business.
