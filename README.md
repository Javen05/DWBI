# DWBI
Data Warehouse and Business Intelligence

## Takeaway from Project:
Through this project, I learnt to design a star schema for storing data in a format that enables intuitive usage and analysis. I also learnt to use stored procedures for updating SCDs in my dimension tables and using an SQL script to import data from CSV files, along with learning a new ETL tool, Alteryx, for data cleaning and transformation. Finally, I understood how to extract insights and generate actionable recommendations from data, and present them effectively to business stakeholders to help them make informed business decisions.
